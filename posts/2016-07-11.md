### Five Days of Kubernetes 1.3 
Last week we [released Kubernetes 1.3](http://blog.kubernetes.io/2016/07/kubernetes-1.3-bridging-cloud-native-and-enterprise-workloads.html), two years from the day when the first Kubernetes commit was pushed to GitHub. Now 30,000+ commits later from over 800 contributors, this 1.3 releases is jam packed with updates driven by feedback from users.  
  
While many new improvements and features have been added in the latest release, we’ll be highlighting several that stand-out. Follow along and read these in-depth posts on what’s new and how we continue to make Kubernetes the best way to manage containers at scale.&nbsp;

Minikube also comes with the Kubernetes Dashboard. To open this up in your browser, you can use the built-in `minikube dashboard` command:

In general, Minikube supports everything you would expect from a Kubernetes cluster. You can use `kubectl exec` to get a bash shell inside a pod in your cluster. You can use the `kubectl port-forward` and `kubectl proxy` commands to forward traffic from localhost to a pod or the API server.
  

  

Since Minikube is running locally instead of on a cloud provider, certain provider-specific features like LoadBalancers and PersistentVolumes will not work out-of-the-box. However, you can use NodePort LoadBalancers and HostPath PersistentVolumes.

  

**Architecture**

  

  

Minikube is built on top of Docker's&nbsp;[libmachine](https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/libmachine), and leverages the driver model to create, manage and interact with locally-run virtual machines.
  

  

[RedSpread](https://redspread.com/)&nbsp;was kind enough to donate their [localkube](https://github.com/redspread/localkube)&nbsp;codebase to the Minikube repo, which we use to spin up a single-process Kubernetes cluster inside a VM. Localkube bundles etcd, DNS, the Kubelet and all the Kubernetes master components into a single Go binary, and runs them all via separate goroutines.

  

**Upcoming Features**

  

Minikube has been a lot of fun to work on so far, and we're always looking to improve Minikube to make the Kubernetes development experience better. If you have any ideas for features, don't hesitate to let us know in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues).&nbsp;

  

Here's a list of some of the things we're hoping to add to Minikube soon:

  

- Native hypervisor support for OSX and Windows

  - We're planning to remove the dependency on Virtualbox, and integrate with the native hypervisors included in OSX and Windows (Hypervisor.framework and Hyper-v, respectively).
- Improved support for Kubernetes features

  - We're planning to increase the range of supported Kubernetes features, to include things like Ingress.
- Configurable versions of Kubernetes

  - Today Minikube only supports Kubernetes 1.3. We're planning to add support for user-configurable versions of Kubernetes, to make it easier to match what you have running in production on your laptop.

  

  
**Community**  

  

We'd love to hear feedback on Minikube. To join the community:

- Post issues or feature requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube)
- Join us in the #minikube channel on [Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/)

Please give Minikube a try, and let us know how it goes!
